# Agentic AI

Built this simple agentic AI to explore goal-oriented systems. Shows how an agent handles research, scheduling, and writing tasks through planning and execution. Code is minimal to highlight core concepts. Demonstrates the fundamentals of agent architecture without external APIs or LLMs.

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook implements a lightweight agentic AI system that demonstrates:

- Goal-oriented behavior
- Context-aware planning
- Sequential execution of steps
- Progress tracking and status reporting

## How It Works

The agent follows a simple but effective process:
1. Accepts a goal from the user
2. Creates a plan based on the goal type (research, scheduling, writing, etc.)
3. Executes each step in sequence
4. Reports on progress and completion

## Examples

The notebook includes demonstrations of the agent handling:
- Research tasks
- Scheduling tasks
- Writing tasks
- Custom goals

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Run all cells to see the agent demonstrations
4. Modify the final example to test with your own goals

## Technical Concepts

This implementation demonstrates key concepts in agentic AI:
- State management
- Goal decomposition
- Task planning
- Execution monitoring

## Future Improvements

While intentionally minimal, this project could be extended with:
- Integration with real tools and APIs
- Natural language understanding
- Dynamic replanning
- Memory of past interactions
